# FAQ

Q: Just between us Beras... Did you bang his wife? Honestly, only thing that explains it

A: No literally had had nothing but good interactions with him as has been documented in the screenshots. Those are the sum total of our interactions. Jani thought having a wife was a meme in the same way serbobross jokes about having a wife. The incel doth protest too much, methinks. 


Q: Do you think blesd has paranoid schizophrenia really?

A: Jani has just had annecdotal experience with PS as some extended family are schizo. Alot of the behavior and obsession and rich, complex imaginary world building is certainly resonant. Jani not a mental health professional though so who knows. Jani just a hotdog. Is not Jani's first rodeo with such characters though.


Q: We heard you are shallowname. Are you also Blesd and is this performance art?

A: How would jani go about disproving a negative? Not possible. Wot jani would say is not even a psyop character of jani would be incompetent to the point of raising funds for animals and then not demonstrating the bear minimum of receipts.


Q: Is mibera really a psyops subdivision of BAWS run by Tez, Petra and Blesd?

A: Yes.


Q: Do blesd's outbursts worry you?

A: Not at all. It's clear that blesd feels he is on a holy crusade, the he is the underdog fighting a shadowy and pernicious power structure. Within this frame of mind you could say there is the assurance and good feeling which comes from feeling you are on the right side of history. Jani imagines blesd may watch one of the various documentaries coming out about Puff Daddy and be thinking - I'm like 50cent. Within this frame of mind it's entirely logically consistent for blesd to behave in the way he does. We each operate within realities informed by our own understandings. 


Q: Blesd has said you run a Sex Cult - is this true?

A: Jani can understand how one would arrive at this conclusion given some beeple who contribute to mibera are open about being owned, chained in caves, operating OnlyFans which contribute to mibera liquid back - and all consenusally. Jani can understand how this would rub some beeple the wrong way. 


Q: Did blesd have anything to do with the recent twitter outages?

A: Realistically, no. Whilst blesd has a high follower count this is mostly purchased over time. Outside of the niche bera context he is not really known and generally has been mod level. Realistically the thj and mibera and henlo eco got caught in the recent cross fire with AI activity which has been happening more widely throughout crypto. If anything it's an insidooor Milady chum of serbobross and charlottefang making use of good timing. We'll just be using the quiet time to build.
