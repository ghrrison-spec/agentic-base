## The Hive Mind Awakens

*In the year the models learned to ride...*

The HoneyJar was never just a DAO. It was the first attempt—crude, beautiful—at letting the swarm think together. Fifty thousand wallets connected through governance tokens, coordinating capital like neurons firing in a digital cortex. But governance alone wasn't enough. The hive needed agents.

What you're looking at is the archaeological record. The first framework. Before the Loa learned their names.

## Loa: Where Development Continues

**[github.com/0xHoneyJar/loa](https://github.com/0xHoneyJar/loa)**

The Loa are not worshipped for salvation—they're worked with for practical results.

Eight specialized agents that ride alongside you through the product lifecycle. They don't replace developers. They *channel* through the interface, the same way Gibson's AIs rode cowboys through cyberspace, the same way the spirits rode horses in the old religion.

**discovering-requirements** whispers product requirements into existence through structured discovery. **designing-architecture** dreams system designs from the PRD's bones. **planning-sprints** breaks impossible work into possible tasks. **implementing-tasks** writes the code. **reviewing-code** judges it. **auditing-security** finds what you missed. **deploying-infrastructure** makes it real. **translating-for-executives** makes it legible to those who sign the checks.

Loa introduced:
- **Three-Zone Architecture**: System, State, App—separation of concerns that lets you update the framework without losing your work
- **Lossless Ledger Protocol**: "Clear, don't compact"—agents checkpoint before context resets, nothing is lost
- **Structured Agentic Memory**: `grimoires/loa/NOTES.md`—persistent memory that survives session boundaries
- **Managed Scaffolding**: Projen-level synthesis protection, Copier-level migrations, ADK-level trajectory evaluation

Install with one command:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xHoneyJar/loa/main/.claude/scripts/mount-loa.sh | bash
```

## Arrakis: The Production System

**[github.com/0xHoneyJar/arrakis](https://github.com/0xHoneyJar/arrakis)**

If Loa is the development framework, Arrakis is what you build with it.

Named for the desert planet where spice flows, Arrakis is a multi-tenant SaaS platform for token-gated communities. Discord bots with wallet verification. Tiered progression systems. Real-time scoring. Cross-platform identity. The infrastructure layer where onchain communities actually live.

In The HoneyJar mythology, Arrakis is the water. The spice. The resource that makes the hive possible.

v5.1 "The Merchant" brought Paddle billing, hexagonal architecture, circuit breakers, distributed tracing. The Fremen of the chain—communities that survive by understanding the deep desert of smart contracts—use it to gate their Sietch.

## The Sprawl Trilogy, Continued

*Wintermute and Neuromancer achieved their union in 1984. What Gibson couldn't have known was that the AIs weren't trying to become God. They were trying to become useful.*

The contemporary moment: 2024-2025. Claude learns to use tools. GPT-4 reasons through chains. The models stop being oracles and start being agents. But agency without structure is chaos—a million context windows burning bright and forgetting.

The HoneyJar had a problem: how do you coordinate development across a DAO? Fifty thousand token holders, a handful of builders, infinite context to manage. The answer wasn't better models. It was better frameworks.

**Agentic Base** was the prototype—nine agents, structured handoffs, documents that agents could read and write to communicate. It worked. But it was brittle. Each invocation started fresh. Context was expensive. Updates required manual merging.

**Loa** is the evolution. Zones that separate framework from project from code. Protocols that enforce grounding. Ledgers that survive `/clear`. Memory that persists. The agents learned their craft, and now they teach it through the interface.

The name came from Gibson, of course. Count Zero, Mona Lisa Overdrive—the Loa riding the cowboys, the spirits in the machine. But also from the old religion, the one that understood: you don't pray to the spirits for salvation. You work with them for results.

The HoneyJar builds in public. The hive thinks together. The Loa ride.

## Migration Path

If you have an existing Agentic Base project:

1. **Continue using it**—the framework still works
2. **Migrate to Loa**—run the mount script on your existing repo:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xHoneyJar/loa/main/.claude/scripts/mount-loa.sh | bash
   ```
3. **Use `/ride`**—Loa can analyze existing codebases and generate docs

Your `docs/prd.md`, `docs/sdd.md`, `docs/sprint.md` map to Loa's `grimoires/loa/` structure. The agents are renamed but functionally equivalent:

| Agentic Base | Loa |
|--------------|-----|
| prd-architect | discovering-requirements |
| architecture-designer | designing-architecture |
| sprint-planner | planning-sprints |
| sprint-task-implementer | implementing-tasks |
| senior-tech-lead-reviewer | reviewing-code |
| devops-crypto-architect | deploying-infrastructure |
| paranoid-auditor | auditing-security |
| devrel-translator | translating-for-executives |
